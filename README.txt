Decentralized Blockchain-Based Voting System
Prototype Version – Algorand TestNet Demo

This project demonstrates:
- Wallet-based authentication
- One-person-one-vote enforcement
- Secure vote storage
- Transparent result calculation

Note:
This prototype simulates Algorand blockchain logic.
In real deployment, votes would be stored using Algorand smart contracts.
